// Validating benchmarks:
// Benchmark Benchmarks.Wotkload_Thread: DefaultJob
//    * Benchmarked method `Wotkload_Thread` is within a non-visible class, all declaring types must be public.

// Benchmark Benchmarks.Workload_ThreadPool: DefaultJob
//    * Benchmarked method `Workload_ThreadPool` is within a non-visible class, all declaring types must be public.

//    * Assembly _02_ThreadPool which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
Benchmark was built without optimization enabled (most probably a DEBUG configuration). Please, build it in RELEASE.
